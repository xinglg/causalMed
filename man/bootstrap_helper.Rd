  models,
  intervention,
  init_recode = NULL,
  in_recode = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{data}{Data set to be sued}

\item{id_var}{ID variable per subject.}

\item{base_vars}{A vector of time fixed baseline variables.}

\item{time_var}{Time variable.}

\item{exposure}{Intervention/Exposure variable}

\item{models}{A list of models for the G-formula, including exposure model,
 covariate model (if any), mediator model (if any), outcome model or
 censoring model (if any). See details in \code{\link{spec_model}}.
 The order appeared in the list should reflect the temporal ordering of the
 variables, in another way data generation process. The model will be evaluated
in this process.}

\item{intervention}{A named list with a value of intervention on exposure.
if kept as NULL (default), the natural intervention course will be calculated.
 eg: list(natural = NULL, always = c(1, 1, 1), never = c(0, 0, 0)). Note that
the function will add the natural effect by default if the natural effect is
not define here, and the reference intervention in \code{ref_int} will be set
to the natural effect.}

\item{init_recode}{optional, recoding of variables done at the
beginning of the Monte Carlo loop. Needed for operations initialize baseline variables.
This is executed at beginning of the Monte Carlo g-formula, executed only once at time 0.}

\item{in_recode}{optional, On the fly recoding of variables done before the Monte
Carlo loop starts. Needed to do any kind of functional forms for entry times.
 This is executed at each start of the Monte Carlo g-formula time steps}

\item{out_recode}{optional, On the fly recoding of variables done at the
end of the Monte Carlo loop. Needed for operations like counting the number of
days with a treatment or creating lagged variables. This is executed at each end
 of the Monte Carlo g-formula time steps.}

\item{mc_sample}{Integer, sample size of Monte Carlo simulation. Default is 100 times of
original sample.}

\item{R}{The number of bootstrap replicates, default is 500. If the R is larger than 1,
\code{\link[future.apply]{future_lapply}} is used for the parallel computation. This will
 run in sequential if no parallel planed, see \code{\link[future]{plan}} for more details.
If the parallel plan was set to \code{plan(multisession)} in Windows or \code{plan(multicore)}
in other system, multiple session/core is used for bootstrap calculation.}
