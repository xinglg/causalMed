  data,

\arguments{
\item{data}{Data to be used for the data generation}

\item{exposure}{Intervention/Exposure variable}

\item{models}{Model list passed from \code{\link{gformula}} or \code{\link{mediation}}.}

\item{mediation_type}{Type of the mediation analysis.}

\item{time_var}{Time variable.}

\item{init_recode}{optional, recoding of variables done at the
beginning of the Monte Carlo loop. Needed for operations initialize baseline variables.
This is executed at beginning of the Monte Carlo g-formula, executed only once at time 0.}

\item{in_recode}{optional, On the fly recoding of variables done before the Monte
Carlo loop starts. Needed to do any kind of functional forms for entry times.
 This is executed at each start of the Monte Carlo g-formula time steps}

\item{out_recode}{optional, On the fly recoding of variables done at the
end of the Monte Carlo loop. Needed for operations like counting the number of
days with a treatment or creating lagged variables. This is executed at each end
 of the Monte Carlo g-formula time steps.}

\item{return_data}{Logical scalar indicating whether to return the Monte Carlo simulated data set,
 default is \code{FALSE}. In the case of large \code{mc_sample} and long follow-up, the simulated
data will be very large causing problems no enough memory to allocate the objects.}

\item{progress_bar}{Progress bar object.}
}

Loop through the models and apply any recoding or subset.
